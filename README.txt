## TODO:
- [ ] currently just blocking progression until it is in the CACHE, definitely faster way, costs us potentially an extra cycle
- [ ] check mux is the correct way round
- [x] implement enable that prevents progression
- [ ] implement new way to read from RAM and wait appropriate cycle until it is out and use this output to control the progression, this is costing us a cycle at the moment
