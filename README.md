### RULES: 
* Make a new branch for every feature, i.e PC and ALU are on separate branches. Once a fully working CPU is achieved, we will make new branches for every version but for now stick to your own branch.
* Playground branch is for testing experimental features
* Write your own testbench to test each feature, and keep it in a folder called <feature_name>, and set up a `.gitignore` file to not commit obj_dir and other junk
* Label inputs and output of System Verilog files with `_i` and `_o`, for instance ```verilog input logic   Alusrc_i,```
* Ask for help if you need it
* Keep a `<feature_name>.md` (markdown) file for explaining what your current progress is

### Git:
* _Do not commit to main !!!_
* Only merge after checking with the group whatsapp chat
* Commit only working code, comment out stuff if its a work in progress
