## F1 Program:

Please find inside the evidence folder, 2 videos showing obvious but not that random delay and limited random delay (less than 3 seconds following F1 rules) with the F1 program. F1.vcd is also provided in this repo. The third video shows the working trigger. If you run the code it will wait for the trigger every time after one sequence is finished and the delay of the lights to turn off will be random, always less than 3 seconds.
